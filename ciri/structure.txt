The ciri library is a mixture of platform-independent source code and platform-agnostic interfaces, with the latter
having no formal definition directly within ciri.  What this means is that ciri provides interfaces for platform-specific
code which is then linked in to ciri externally to provide concrete functionality.  For example, windows are created
in very different ways on different platforms.  The traditional method is to have a large number of preprocessor checks
in various files, which quickly gets painful to manage.  Instead, ciri opts for providing an interface for what a window
should do, and then a library is linked in providing concrete functionality for that interface, as well as a method of
instantiating the concretion.  ciri's window component on the Windows operating system could be linked in when compiling
for Windows, and the window component of OS X could be linked in when appropriate; ciri does not care what is linked, as
long as it implements what it needs to.
	This separation means that ciri can be easily recompiled per platform.  The downside is that, on Windows, it no longer
allows for switching between DirectX and OpenGL in the target application; ciri defines that dependent on what is linked.
However, ciri was not intended to be a switchable library.
	ciri's platform specific source code is self-contained within ciri's according folders (although this does not have to
be the case) to simplify projects.  For example, ciri's input contains a 'win' folder of which contains headers or source
files for the Windows implementation of input.  On platforms other than Windows, this folder can simply be ignored.
Likewise, an OS X folder could be inserted at the same location for compilation on that platform.
